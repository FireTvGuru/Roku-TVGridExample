# TVGridExample

This code is a modified excerpt of code used in the [What's On Roku Channel](http://forums.roku.com/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=46890&p=318388) for the display of TV listings.

This code is not intended to be used as a "library" or "template" that you can just plug in to your own channel. Its purpose is to merely serve as an "example" of how the TV listings display was implemented in the What's On Channel.

Feel free to use any of the concepts, ideas, or code snippets from this channel in your own implementation.
